                TRANSFORMING EDUCATION: REIMAGINING LEARNING FOR FUTURE-READY TALENT
            </h2>
            <p>With the global economy increasingly centered on knowledge and skill, educational
                institutions are moving from traditional teaching methods to custom methodologies that
                promote anytime, personalized, and adaptive learning. Disruption in education with the adoption of
                online learning platforms and the move to cloud-based solutions have brought about radical changes
                in education. Equity in education and accessibility to learning are key. The COVID-19 pandemic
                has served as one of the biggest disruptors as well as accelerators in the education sector by
                making online learning feasible, easily accessible, attractive, and effective. Education has
                expanded out of physical spaces to evolve into a blended classroom marked by anywhere, anytime
                learning. Blended, technology-supported education that is ‘phygital’ in nature and aimed at
                improving personalization, engagement, and ultimately outcomes, will not only enrich students,
                but also teachers and institutions — a win-win for individuals, government, and society.</p>

                Current trends
            </h3>
            <p>For some time now, educational institutions have been facing challenges in enrolment and funding, both of which were further hit on account of COVID-19. According to reports, a significant drop in student enrolments is expected in the short term. This trend has been visible for some time. As higher education has continually become more expensive and unattainable, students have found online courses to be an easier way to secure degrees and, consequently, jobs quickly.</p>
